These two maps show county-wide percentages of adults with certain levels of education. The top map shows the percent of adults with a bachelor's degree in 2015, while the bottom map shows the percent of adults with less than a high school diploma. It might be expected that areas near cities have higher levels of college graduates, but there's also a large portion of Colorado that also has a high graduate percentage. Counties with high percentages of adults without high school degrees are centered around southern Texas and in somee rural Southeastern States.
