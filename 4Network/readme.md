This is a snapshot of football games up to week ten of the NCAA college football season. The larger circles are teams in the top 25, which are the teams to focus on, while the smaller circles are teams that they have played over the previous ten weeks. The teams are organized by conference, so we can see that most of the conferences got clustered together since they have more games with each other. We can see that there are a few large circles for each conference, so we don't have a single dominating conference, rather a few top teams per conference.
