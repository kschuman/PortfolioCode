This map of the U.S. shows county-wide cancer rates and proximities to land use sides, large resevoirs, and large manufacturing sites. Darker counties have higher cancer rates. Hovering over any county will give specific cancer rates. You can also see the Rural-Urban spread of the United States with the 'Rural Urban Continuum Codes,' which indicates whether a county is a large, or small city, near a large or small city, or completely rural. Darker colors (closer to 1) are city regions, while the lighest colored areas (close to 9) are rural.
