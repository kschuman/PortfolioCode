Looking on a map doesn't give a good idea of the population density in each part of the world. This map shows where populations are most concentrated based on their cardinal points (North, South, East, West). We can see that over 50% of the population is located in the East and Northeast (with the center point being the center point at the Equator and Prime Meridian), which is where India, China, and other populous countries are. Comparitavely, the Southern and Eastern hemispheres have very small populations.
