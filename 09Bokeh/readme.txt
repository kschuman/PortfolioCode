This plot the percentages of adults with bachelors degrees and adults without high school diplomas. Most counties have a population with about 5-30% of adults lacking a high school diploma, but between 10 and 40% of adults with a bachelor's degree. The color shows the region that a county is in, and we can see the darker colors (Southern states) generally have lower graduate rates for both high school and college. Some of the outliers are Arlington, VA and Los Alamos, NM (very low high school dropout, high college graduation), and Starr, TX and Hudspeth, TX (high high school dropout, low college graduation).
