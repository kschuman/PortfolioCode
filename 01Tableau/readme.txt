Cell phone usage and internet access has increased dramatically in recent years, and we can see how quickly people have been able to take advantage of new technologies in these maps. On top, we can see how many cell phone plans were active in each country from 1960 to 2014 (per 100 people). Similarly, the bottom graphic shows the number of people (per 100) with broadband subscriptions during the same time period. These graphics indicate it may be better to use cell phones to get technology to remote areas, since internet may not be as easy for locals to access.
